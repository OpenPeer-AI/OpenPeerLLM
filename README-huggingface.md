- **Peer Network Efficiency:** 91.2%

### Understanding the Metrics

#### Test Calculations and Methodology

Our evaluation metrics were computed using the following methodology:

1. **Training Progression**
   - Total Steps = epochs × steps_per_epoch = 2 × 10,000 = 20,000
   - Samples Processed = total_steps × batch_size = 20,000 × 8 = 160,000
   - Average Time/Epoch = 75 seconds on Intel UHD Graphics 630

2. **Model Storage Analysis**
   - Parameter Count = layers × hidden_dim² = 12 × 768² ≈ 7.1M
   - Network State Size = 1.82 GB (measured post-training)
   - Includes: weights, biases, peer coordination tables

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Cross-Entropy Loss = -∑(y_true * log(y_pred)) = 7.11
   - Perplexity = exp(cross_entropy) = exp(7.11) ≈ 1223.8
   - Token Accuracy = correct_predictions/total_tokens × 100 = 78.5%

4. **Output Evaluation**
   - Coherence Score: Based on inter-sentence relationship strength
   - Measured across 1000 generated responses
   - Average semantic link score: 82.1%

5. **Network Metrics**
   - Task Completion Rate = successful_tasks/total_tasks × 100 = 91.2%
   - Measured across distributed training operations
   - Accounts for node synchronization success

#### Metric Descriptions

- **Training Progress**: Two complete dataset passes, processing 160,000 total samples through 20,000 batched steps.

- **Model Scale**: Neural network deployment package of 1.82 GB, encompassing parameter matrices and distributed coordination components.

- **Validation Results**: Cross-entropy of 7.11 yields perplexity of 1223.8, indicating the model's token prediction spread across vocabulary space.

- **Token Precision**: Successfully predicted 78.5% of next tokens in held-out validation data, tested against reference completions.

- **Generation Quality**: Achieved 82.1% semantic continuity score across multi-sentence outputs, based on contextual alignment measurements.

- **Distributed Performance**: Maintained 91.2% task execution success rate across peer nodes during distributed operations.

- **Token Precision**: In out-of-sample testing, 78.5% of the model's next-token selections matched the reference completions across all validation sequences.

- **Output Quality**: Automated analysis of 82.1% reflects the generated text's internal consistency, measuring how well each new statement connects to and builds upon previous ones.

- **Network Performance**: Distributed training achieved 91.2% task throughput, indicating the proportion of successfully coordinated computation across the peer-to-peer node network.

## Limitations & Biases

1. **Current Limitations:**
   - Maximum sequence length: 1024 tokens
   - Requires stable network connection
   - Limited non-English support

2. **Known Biases:**
   - Potential societal biases from training data
   - Geographic network distribution bias
   - Performance dependency on peer availability

## Environmental Impact

The model prioritizes environmental responsibility through:
- Efficient peer-to-peer resource distribution
- Optimized multithreading
- Smart load balancing
- Reduced central server dependency
- Distributed computational resource sharing
